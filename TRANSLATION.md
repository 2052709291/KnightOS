# Translation Guide

There is an effort to translate KnightOS into various languages. The master branch
is in English, and there are alternate branches in different languages. The current
list of language projects is:

* French

If you wish to contribute, fork KnightOS and work on the branch for the language you
wish to work on. You should create a pull reqeust every so often to add more content
in the language you are working on. Be sure to follow the generic coding style
guidelines. All code and comments must remain in English, only user-visible text
should be translated. File names should not be changed. Grammar and spelling are of
upmost importance, make sure that you get this right.

You should also update various files within the repository, such as the README and
any documentation.

Do not use Google Translate. You should not participate in a translation effort
if you are not profecient in the language you are translating.

Finally, make sure that you keep your language's branch up to date. Frequently merge
changes in the English master branch with your branch.
